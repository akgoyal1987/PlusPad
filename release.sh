Artifacts are in dist/. To publish:

  gh release create v${VERSION} dist/*.zip dist/SHA256SUMS.txt \\
      --title "v${VERSION}" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md

The bundle is ad-hoc signed, so on another Mac Gatekeeper will refuse the first
launch. The release notes tell people how to clear the quarantine flag.
Shipping without that friction needs a paid Apple Developer ID and notarisation.
